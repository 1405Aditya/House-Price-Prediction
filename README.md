# House-Price-Prediction

The aim of this project is to predict house prices using various regression techniques. We explore three different models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression. Each model offers distinct advantages and handles data in unique ways, helping us understand the dynamics and influences on house prices.
