# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting residential property prices using machine learning techniques based on multiple influencing factors such as location, size, number of rooms, and other housing attributes. The goal is to analyze historical housing data stored in a structured CSV dataset and uncover patterns that significantly impact pricing trends. Regression-based machine learning models are developed to estimate house prices with high accuracy. The project emphasizes data preprocessing, feature analysis, and model evaluation. It provides actionable insights that can support real estate decision-making and pricing strategies.
